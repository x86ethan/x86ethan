# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ethan Robert, a Full-Stack dev!
I've always been interested in computers, tech, and systems. I started learning how to code at age 12. Over the years, I got more and more experience and knowledge about how computers work.
Today, I'm studying Computer Science at the (https://iut.univ-lille.fr)[Universitary Institute of Technology in Lille, FR]. 

If interested, you can also visit my (https://github.com/khyrthy)[former GitHub profile]. It contains old projects, like a game I made during my childhood, and old websites!
